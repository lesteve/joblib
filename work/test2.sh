# This script aims to test/prove that you can append to a single file from
# multiple processes with buffers up to a certain size, without causing one
# process' output to corrupt the other's.
#
# The script takes one parameter, the length of the buffer. It then creates
# 20 worker processes which each write 50 lines of the specified buffer
# size to the same file. When all processes are done outputting, it tests
# the output file to ensure it is in the correct format.
